# Winner's Rule

A competitive party game built in Unity where players compete in dynamic minigames with ever-changing rules.  
Players compete in short minigames, and each round's winner drafts a temporary rule card that changes how the next round plays. Cards provide powerful advantages but include meaningful drawbacks, forcing strategic choices.
